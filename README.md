ECCE App Challenge 2018 

1/22/2018 1st Meeting
Idea: User Decided Calgary Community Hunting App (UDCCHA)
Users can select their own monthly budget (or income level), Main transportation, Student/Working, then our app yield the most suitable community in the town for them. With certain range (Buffer), we also show them the closest facilitiesâ€™ location, and some nearby outdoor activity places rank (Bike lane rank).
